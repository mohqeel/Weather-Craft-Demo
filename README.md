# Craft Demo

## Running the project
* Make sure you have at least node 7.6 installed
* Run the command ```npm install``` in the directory
* Run the command ```node server.js``` to start the server
* Double click on the ```index.html``` file to view the project

## View Tests
* Click on ```test.html``` to run and view the tests in browser

## Things I would have done if I had more time
* Minifying and uglifying the files
* Use a CSS preprocessor such as SASS/SCSS
* Show a more defined error to the user (e.g. server is down, error on server)
* Try to build everything into one JS file so we can reduce number of HTTP calls
* Trying to have the server serve the page instead of clicking the HTML file
* Check if server is on before calling the get weather tests
